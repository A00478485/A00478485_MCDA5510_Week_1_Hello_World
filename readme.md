# A00478485_MCDA5510_Week_1_Hello_World - Bhavy Doshi
I'm Bhavy Doshi from India and I recently joined the MCDA program in the Fall 2023 cohort after working for 5 years in TCS and Barclays Bank perming the role of auditor and developer. My banner ID is A00878485 and you can reach me by email at Bhavy.Doshi@smu.ca

I have been grouped with Subhi (A00473252) and Papa (A00477519) due to their similar background in banking, cooking and being dog lovers. We all have worked in either front desk jobs serving customers through IT resolution or worked in the data warehouse for grading the risk associated with the customer. We also liked cooking because it's a science which brings joy to the food consumer and the right amount of spices can make the taste of a dish so delicious.

On top of all the above mentioned, we all have seen the F.R.I.E.N.D.S. and we all love the chemistry between Rachel and Ross even though we do have some arguments about "Were they on break or not ?". The duo of Phoebe and Joey never misses to spice things up in most of the episodes and we all were laughing about discussing "The One With The Worst Thanksgiving" Episode.

Bhavy (A00478485)
    - I used to work in the risk department in the banking firm and used to deal with 100+ GBs of data per day so I was curious about it and started searching for a course which can help me learn about analytics on top of it. That's when MSc-CDA offered the opportunity to achieve that goal as the name itself says Data Analytics with a practical approach and syllabus has all the major topics which are trending in the market.
    - The name of Wi-Fi at home is "Dal And Chawal" which is an Indian dish containing rice and beans.

Subhi (A00473252)
    - Subhi used to work as a data warehouse developer in a firm from India and having learnt that, she realised the potential behind it soon along with developing an application which generates it. She started searching for a source which could help with her curiosity and found MSc-CDA suitable answering most of the questions.
    - Subhi likes the Japanese language and she expressed it to Yasushi during the lecture but she still doesn't watch Anime.

Papa (A00477519)
    - Papa completed his undergraduate from Ghana and worked in the banking sector for his internship. During his internship and after completing his undergraduate, he started finding a course that balanced topics between the theoretical aspects of computer science and brought practical applications to the table. He came across with MSc-CDA program after doing tons of research.
    - Papa loves fashion (specially street-wears) and he listens to Afro beats. He told us that he eats a lot but doesn't get healthy so we decided to test this theory soon.
